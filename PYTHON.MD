### Python Installation

So, you've installed the VSCode _extensions_, but it's asking you to install the Python _language_.

Go to [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version. Open the executable.

Uncheck the box that says "install for all users", located near the bottom of the installer window. Now, click the first arrow from the top (of the window) and install Python for your account.

On your Python (`.py`) file, there should now be a green triangle in the upper right corner. Clicking it runs your code.

If you do that, and...

It gives you an error message in white text -> Likely means something is wrong with your code. Double check that.

It gives you an error in red text -> VSCode may not be able to find your python installation. Keep reading below

#### The Case of the Missing Python Installation

With your python (`.py`) file open, look at the bottom of the VSCode window.
