TESTING GITHUB PAGES SUPPORT FOR README.MD INSTEAD OF INDEX.MD

Best advice for now is to go poking around repos. A lot of little settings to fiddle with.

## VSCode

"Black Magic!" - Karl Helmstetter, 2021

VSCode is a highly customizable IDE, more capable than Mu or Repl.it, but comes with a learning curver. If you want to forge your path; through trial and error; through fire and brimstone; then go right ahead! Close this, and figure it out. However, if you want helpful resources for your adventure, then continue reading.

### Issues

If you have any issues with this, please send me a

### Setup

Open VSCode. It should be already installed on your computer.

On the lower left, at the bottom, there should be a settings icon:

![Settings](/Images/settings-gear.png)

Click it. Next click `Online Services Settings`

On the upper right, click `Settings Sync`

Click `Sign-in and Turn On`, then `Sign-in with GitHub`

It will walk you through the process of logging in.

Now, hit `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type `Git: Clone` and the command should appear. If you succesfully logged in with GitHub, you can click `Clone from GitHub`. If the repo wasn't made by you, or you had trouble logging in, you can still provide the repository URL to clone.

VSCode should guide you through where to put the folder.

### Github Built-in Walkthroughs

Hit `Ctrl + Shift + P`, and type `Open Walkthrough`. There are three walkthroughs there. When you install Python (look at [extensions](#extensions) below), one should pop up for setting that up.

### Choose Your Own Adventure

The rest of this guide is a reference for various components of VSCode

- [Git/Source Control](#gitsource-control)
- [Extensions](#extensions)
- [Keyboard Shorcuts](#keyboard-shorcuts)

### Git/Source Control

On the far left sidebar, there should be a branch-like icon:

![Source Control](/Images/source-control.png)

Click it. This is where VSCode manages all the source control betweeen your local computer and your git repository in the cloud. However, _you can always use VSCode without a repo_!

### Extensions

Also on the far-left sidebar, you'll see an icon that looks like this:

![Extensions](/Images/extensions.png)

Click it. It shows the extensions already installed, and the recommended extentions to be installed. Below are some links to extensions for various purposes.

Remember: These extensions have their own documentation too.

_Install as you see fit!_
