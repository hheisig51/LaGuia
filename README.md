## Github

WIP.

Best advice for now is to go poking around repos. A lot of little settings to fiddle with.

## VSCode

"Black Magic!" - Karl Helmstetter, 2021

VSCode is a highly customizable IDE, more capable than Mu or Repl.it, but harder to optimize to. If you want to forge your path; through trial and error; through fire and brimstone; then go right ahead! Close this, and figure it out. However, if you want helpful resources for your adventure, then continue reading.

### First Time

On the lower left, second from the bottom, click on the Accounts icon, and log in.

PLACEHOLDER FOR ICON

Now, hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`, type `Git: Clone` and the command should appear. If you succesfully logged in with GitHub, you can click `Clone from GitHub`. If the repo wasn't made by you, or you had trouble logging in, you can still provide the repository URL to clone.

### Git

### Extensions

On the far-left sidebar, you'll see an icon that looks like this:

PLACEHOLDER FOR EXTENSIONS ICON

Click it. It shows the extensions already installed, and the recommended extentions to be installed. Below are some links to extensions for various purposes. Install as you see fit!

### Keyboard Shorcuts

Just checking if you're reading this ;)

Tell me the words "Pineapple Tango" if you've made it this far.

## Markdown

Follow the [advice of John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), the person who made Markdown back in 2004.

## Reminder
